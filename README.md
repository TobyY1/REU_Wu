NOTES ABOUT OUR ADDITIONS 

We Consider two things when labeling these countries:
1. The relative value of rGDP per capita against other countries.
2. The growth trends of countries. 

Type 1 Early Developed Economies:
Consistent, steady growth rate, high rGDP per capita from the start.

Type 2 Fully Caught up Economies:
Begin noticeably lower than type 1's, exponential growth rate at some point to “catch up” to Type 1’s.

Type 3 Middle Income Trap Economies:
Consistent, steady growth rate (Like type 1), but noticeably lower nominal values at all points.

Type 4 Emerging Economies: 

Type 5 Economies in a Poverty Trap:
Little signs of growth, nominally very low real GDP per capita.

Type 6 Former USSR and Yugoslavia Economies:
These countries tend to have interesting dips in their rGDP per capita early on, it’s unclear as to why.

Type 7 Regressing Economies:
There is a rGDP growth trend, but it doesn’t fall into the previous categories. 

Type 0: Odd patterns:
Not enough data to give a trend, or there isn’t a clear trend.


OTHER VARIABLES WE ADDED

Flag = 0: if we are confident in the grouping we gave

Flag > 0: The value indicates the average of the two groups it could be.
EXAMPLE: flag = 1.5 means we placed it as a 1 (or 2) but we acknowledge that it could be a 2 (or 1)

FmrUSSR: = 1 if the country was a part of the USSR, these countries tend to have interesting patterns in the early years of their data. These countries declared independence starting March 1990 to December 1991.

FmrYugo: = 1 if the country was a part of Yugoslavia, began disbanding in 1991, finished in 2000’s.
